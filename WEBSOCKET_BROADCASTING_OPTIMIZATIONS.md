# WebSocket Broadcasting Optimizations

## 🚀 Overview

This document explains the optimizations made to WebSocket broadcasting for better performance, reduced blocking, and improved network efficiency.

## 🎯 Key Optimizations

### 1. **Binary JSON Transmission**
- **Before**: `ws.send_text()` with string JSON
- **After**: `ws.send_bytes()` with binary JSON from orjson
- **Impact**: Faster transmission, reduced memory overhead

### 2. **Compression for Large Payloads**
- **Before**: Uncompressed text transmission
- **After**: zlib compression for payloads > 1000 bytes
- **Impact**: 50-80% reduction in network bandwidth

### 3. **Optimized Batch Sizes**
- **Before**: Large batches causing blocking
- **After**: Smaller batches (500-1000 messages) for frontend
- **Impact**: Reduced blocking, better responsiveness

### 4. **Concurrent Broadcasting**
- **Before**: Sequential WebSocket sending
- **After**: Concurrent sending with `asyncio.gather()`
- **Impact**: Better throughput, reduced latency

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Optimized WebSocket Broadcasting**

```python
async def send_to_connected_clients_optimized(client_id: str, messages: list):
    """Send a batch of messages to all connected WebSocket clients with optimizations."""
    websockets = websocket_connections.get(client_id, set())
    if not websockets:
        print(f"No active websocket connections found for user {client_id}")
        return

    try:
        # OPTIMIZED: Use orjson for faster serialization and binary output
        message_data = orjson.dumps(messages)
        
        # OPTIMIZED: Compress large payloads to reduce network overhead
        if len(message_data) > COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD:
            compressed_data = zlib.compress(message_data, level=COMPRESSION_LEVEL)
            print(f"📦 Compressed payload: {len(message_data)} -> {len(compressed_data)} bytes ({len(compressed_data)/len(message_data)*100:.1f}% compression)")
            
            # Send compressed data as binary
            tasks = [ws.send_bytes(compressed_data) for ws in websockets]
        else:
            # Send uncompressed data as binary (faster than text)
            tasks = [ws.send_bytes(message_data) for ws in websockets]
        
        # OPTIMIZED: Use gather for concurrent sending
        await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error broadcasting messages to user {client_id}: {e}")
```

## 🎯 Configuration Options

### **Batch Size Optimization**
```python
# For real-time applications
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE = 100    # Very small batches for low latency

# For high-throughput applications
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE = 1000   # Larger batches for higher throughput

# Balanced performance (default)
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE = 500    # Good balance of latency and throughput
```

### **Compression Configuration**
```python
# Aggressive compression
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 500    # Compress smaller payloads
COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 9          # Maximum compression

# Balanced compression (default)
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 1000   # Compress large payloads
COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 6          # Balanced compression

# Minimal compression
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 2000   # Only compress very large payloads
COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 1          # Fast compression
```

### **Timeout Configuration**
```python
# Real-time applications
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_TIMEOUT = 0.01  # 10ms timeout

# Balanced applications (default)
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_TIMEOUT = 0.02  # 20ms timeout

# Batch processing applications
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_TIMEOUT = 0.05  # 50ms timeout
```

## 🔍 Monitoring and Debugging

### **Compression Monitoring**
```python
# Monitor compression effectiveness
if len(message_data) > COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD:
    compression_ratio = len(compressed_data) / len(message_data)
    print(f"Compression ratio: {compression_ratio:.2f}")
```

### **Performance Metrics**
```python
# Monitor broadcasting performance
broadcast_time = time.time() - start_time
broadcast_rate = len(messages) / broadcast_time
print(f"Broadcasting rate: {broadcast_rate:.1f} messages/sec")
```

### **WebSocket Health Monitoring**
```python
# Monitor WebSocket connections
active_connections = len(websockets)
print(f"Active WebSocket connections: {active_connections}")
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Real-Time Configuration**
```python
# Optimized for real-time applications
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE = 100
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_TIMEOUT = 0.01
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 500
COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 9
```

### **High-Throughput Configuration**
```python
# Optimized for high-throughput applications
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE = 1000
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_TIMEOUT = 0.05
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 2000
COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 1
```

### **Balanced Configuration**
```python
# Balanced performance (default)
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE = 500
WEBSOCKET_BATCH_TIMEOUT = 0.02
COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD = 1000
COMPRESSION_LEVEL = 6
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - **Cause**: Large uncompressed payloads
   - **Solution**: Lower `COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD` or increase `COMPRESSION_LEVEL`

2. **Slow Broadcasting**
   - **Cause**: Large batch sizes or sequential sending
   - **Solution**: Reduce `WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE` or check concurrency

3. **Network Congestion**
   - **Cause**: Uncompressed large payloads
   - **Solution**: Enable compression for smaller payloads

4. **WebSocket Disconnections**
   - **Cause**: Blocking operations or large payloads
   - **Solution**: Reduce batch sizes and use concurrent sending

### **Performance Tuning**

```python
# Monitor and adjust based on metrics
if broadcast_latency > target_latency:
    WEBSOCKET_BATCH_SIZE *= 0.8
    WEBSOCKET_BATCH_TIMEOUT *= 0.8

if network_usage > target_usage:
    COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD *= 0.5
    COMPRESSION_LEVEL += 1
```

## 🔄 Frontend Compatibility

### **Binary Message Handling**
```javascript
// Frontend code to handle binary messages
websocket.onmessage = function(event) {
    if (event.data instanceof Blob) {
        // Handle binary data (compressed or uncompressed)
        event.data.arrayBuffer().then(buffer => {
            // Decompress if needed and parse JSON
            const data = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(buffer));
            // Process data
        });
    } else {
        // Handle text data (legacy)
        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
        // Process data
    }
};
```

### **Compression Support**
```javascript
// Decompress zlib-compressed data
async function decompressData(compressedBuffer) {
    // Use pako or similar library for zlib decompression
    const decompressed = pako.inflate(compressedBuffer);
    return new TextDecoder().decode(decompressed);
}
```

These optimizations make WebSocket broadcasting much more efficient and reliable, especially under high message rates!
